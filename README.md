### Project title: Presenting your prospective Angel investor with the right answers

The purpose of the analysis is to determine if the Citibike business model in New York can be replicated in Des Moines, Iowa. As the lead data analyst and visionary of this project Iâ€™m working with my friend and potential busines partner who jointly came up with the idea after our recent trip to NYC. We found exploring the city on bikes gave us a more authentic experience.  

### Analysis & Challenges:

A review of the NYC citibike data for the month of August 2019 was used as part of our preliminary analysis. This is the month that NYC is said to have the most traffic. So, the use for biking around the city becomes a viable option especially for young travelers on a budget like us. In 2019 NYC & Company estimated that approximately 67 million visitors visited New York.I would also cross analyze the information with NYC Hotel Occupancy by month. It makes the most sense to analyze data for a few consecutive years: 2016, 2017, and 2018 by quarter due to variance. 

For obvious reasons the magniude of NYCs tourism industry doesn't compare to Des Moines, Iowa which drew in 1.7 million for the State fair in 2019. As natives we are working to analyze other data to get a better sense of the market and how the bikeshare can be presented to our local residents in a way that addresses the everyday community needs of our urban and rural areas. As a next step I would look at cities in the U.S. that share a similar metrics to Des Moines when it comes to domestic and international visitors. As far as business proposals go investors/Angel investors going to want to see a 2-5-year forecast of earnings and when they can expect the break-even point. So we are fine tuning our proposal to make sure we are answering those questions that any angle investor may have. In the meantime please see the data visualizations that we put together as part of the Aug. 2019 NYC data. 

## The below visual data is used to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip for August 2019 to build a data dashboard, story, or report.
